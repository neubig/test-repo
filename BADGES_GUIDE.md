# Migration Progress Badges Guide 🎖️

Generate beautiful, professional SVG badges showing your Python 2 to 3 migration progress. Perfect for README files, documentation, and project dashboards!

## Overview

The badge generator creates GitHub-style SVG badges that visualize your migration progress at a glance. These badges are:

- ✨ **Professional-looking** - Same style as popular GitHub badges (build status, coverage, etc.)
- 📊 **Data-driven** - Automatically calculated from your current migration state
- 🎨 **Color-coded** - Visual indicators show progress levels (red → yellow → green)
- 🔄 **Easy to update** - Regenerate anytime to reflect latest progress
- 📱 **Responsive** - Look great in README files and on project pages
- 🚀 **Motivating** - Visual progress tracking keeps teams engaged

## Quick Start

Generate all badges with one command:

```bash
./py2to3 badges
```

This will create 5 badges in the `badges/` directory and a markdown snippet file for easy embedding.

## Badge Types

The generator creates 5 different badge types:

### 1. Migration Status Badge
Shows overall migration state: "not started", "in progress", "nearly complete", or "complete"

**Example:**
- ![Migration Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/migration-in%20progress-yellow)

**Colors:**
- Red: Not started
- Yellow: In progress
- Light green: Nearly complete (90%+)
- Bright green: Complete

### 2. Progress Percentage Badge
Shows exact completion percentage based on files migrated

**Example:**
- ![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/migration%20progress-73%25-yellowgreen)

**Colors scale from red (0%) → orange → yellow → light green → green → bright green (100%)**

### 3. Files Migrated Badge
Shows count of migrated files vs total files

**Example:**
- ![Files](https://img.shields.io/badge/files%20migrated-45%2F67-yellowgreen)

**Color matches completion percentage**

### 4. Issues Remaining Badge
Shows number of Python 3 compatibility issues still to fix

**Example:**
- ![Issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/issues%20remaining-23-orange)

**Colors:**
- Bright green: 0 issues (none)
- Light green: 1-5 issues
- Yellow: 6-20 issues
- Orange: 21-50 issues
- Red: 50+ issues

### 5. Python Version Badge
Simple indicator showing if code is Python 3 ready

**Example:**
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x%20ready-brightgreen)
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.x%20only-red)

**Colors:**
- Bright green: Python 3 compatible (0 issues)
- Red: Still has Python 2 code (issues found)

### Custom Output Directory

Specify where to save badges:

```bash
./py2to3 badges --output docs/images/badges
```

### Generate Specific Badges

Generate only the badges you need:

```bash
# Generate only status and progress badges
./py2to3 badges --types status,progress

# Generate only issues badge
./py2to3 badges --types issues
```

Available types: `status`, `progress`, `files`, `issues`, `python`

### Skip Markdown Snippet

Don't generate the `README_SNIPPET.md` file:

```bash
./py2to3 badges --no-snippet
```

### Quiet Mode

Suppress the markdown preview in console output:

```bash
./py2to3 badges --quiet
```

## Embedding in README

### Method 1: Copy from Snippet File

After generating badges, the `badges/README_SNIPPET.md` file contains ready-to-use markdown:

```bash
cat badges/README_SNIPPET.md
```

Copy and paste into your README.md.

### Method 2: Manual Embedding

Add badges to your README.md header:

```markdown
# My Python Project

![Migration Status](badges/migration-status.svg)
![Migration Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)
![Files Migrated](badges/files-migrated.svg)
![Issues Remaining](badges/issues-remaining.svg)
![Python Version](badges/python-version.svg)

Converting this project from Python 2 to Python 3...
```

### Method 3: Inline with Other Badges

Mix with other project badges:

```markdown
# My Project

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/user/repo/CI)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/user/repo)
![Migration Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)
![Python Version](badges/python-version.svg)
```

## Tracking Progress Over Time

### Regular Updates

Regenerate badges after migration milestones:

```bash
# After fixing a batch of files
./py2to3 fix src/module1/
./py2to3 badges

# Commit updated badges
git add badges/
git commit -m "Update migration progress badges"
```

### Automated Updates

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/migration.yml
name: Update Migration Badges

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, migration/*]

jobs:
  badges:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Generate badges
        run: ./py2to3 badges
      - name: Commit badges
        run: |
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git add badges/
          git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "chore: update migration badges [skip ci]"
          git push
```

### Show Historical Progress

Keep old versions to show progress:

```bash
# Save milestone snapshots
cp badges/migration-progress.svg docs/progress-week1.svg
# ... continue migration ...
cp badges/migration-progress.svg docs/progress-week2.svg
```

Create a progress gallery in your documentation:

```markdown
## Migration Timeline

### Week 1
![Progress Week 1](docs/progress-week1.svg)

### Week 2
![Progress Week 2](docs/progress-week2.svg)

### Current
![Current Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Project README

Show migration status prominently:

```markdown
# Legacy Python 2 Application

![Migration Status](badges/migration-status.svg)
![Migration Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)

This application is being migrated from Python 2 to Python 3.
Current progress: ![Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)
```

### 2. Team Dashboard

Create a central migration tracking page:

```markdown
# Python 3 Migration Dashboard

## Project Status

| Project | Status | Progress | Issues |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| API Server | ![Status](badges/api-status.svg) | ![Progress](badges/api-progress.svg) | ![Issues](badges/api-issues.svg) |
| Worker | ![Status](badges/worker-status.svg) | ![Progress](badges/worker-progress.svg) | ![Issues](badges/worker-issues.svg) |
| Web UI | ![Status](badges/ui-status.svg) | ![Progress](badges/ui-progress.svg) | ![Issues](badges/ui-issues.svg) |
```

### 3. Documentation

Show version compatibility in docs:

```markdown
# Installation

This project requires Python 3.6+

Current compatibility: ![Python Version](badges/python-version.svg)
```

### 4. Pull Request Templates

Track PR contribution to migration:

```markdown
## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Files migrated: ![Files](badges/files-migrated.svg)
- [ ] Issues resolved: ![Issues](badges/issues-remaining.svg)
- [ ] Tests passing: ![Tests](badges/test-status.svg)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Badges to Git

Badges are small SVG files that should be version controlled:

```bash
git add badges/
git commit -m "Add migration progress badges"
```

This allows:
- Badges to be visible in GitHub README
- Historical tracking of progress
- Easy embedding without external services

### 2. Update Regularly

Regenerate badges at key milestones:
- After fixing a module or package
- At end of each sprint/week
- Before team meetings or status reports
- After resolving major compatibility issues

### 3. Show Multiple Badges

Use several badges together for complete picture:

```markdown
![Status](badges/migration-status.svg)
![Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)
![Issues](badges/issues-remaining.svg)
```

### 4. Link to Detailed Reports

Make badges clickable to detailed reports:

```markdown
[![Migration Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)](migration_report.html)
```

### 5. Celebrate Milestones

Use badges to celebrate progress:

```markdown
## 🎉 Milestone Reached!

We've achieved 50% migration progress!

![Progress](badges/migration-progress.svg)

Only 23 issues remaining!

![Issues](badges/issues-remaining.svg)
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### With Dashboard

Badges complement the interactive dashboard:

```bash
# Update both together
./py2to3 dashboard
./py2to3 badges
```

README gets badges, stakeholders get full dashboard.

### With Stats Tracker

Badges use stats data automatically:

```bash
# Collect stats first
./py2to3 stats collect --save

# Generate badges from stats
./py2to3 badges
```

### With Report Generator

Include badges in HTML reports:

```bash
# Generate report
./py2to3 report -o report.html

# Generate badges
./py2to3 badges

# Reference in documentation
echo "Full report: [report.html](report.html)" >> README.md
```

### With Journal

Track badge updates in migration journal:

```bash
./py2to3 badges
./py2to3 journal add "Updated migration badges - now at 73% complete!"
```

## Technical Details

### Badge Format

Badges are generated as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
- Vector format - scales perfectly at any size
- Small file size (typically <2KB each)
- Native browser support - no dependencies
- Compatible with all markdown renderers

### Data Source

Badges use migration statistics from:
1. `.migration_stats.json` file (if available from stats tracker)
2. Live verification scan (runs verifier if no stats found)

### Color Scheme

Colors match popular badge services like shields.io:
- Red: `#e05d44` - Problems, not started
- Orange: `#fe7d37` - Many issues
- Yellow: `#dfb317` - Some progress
- Yellow-green: `#a4a61d` - Good progress
- Green: `#97ca00` - Almost done
- Bright green: `#4c1` - Complete!
- Blue: `#007ec6` - Info
- Grey: `#555` / `#9f9f9f` - Neutral

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting Migration

**Initial badges when starting:**

```
migration: not started
migration progress: 0%
files migrated: 0/67
issues remaining: 156
python: 2.x only
```

All badges are red, showing clear need for migration.

### Example 2: Mid-Migration

**Badges after some progress:**

```
migration: in progress
migration progress: 45%
files migrated: 30/67
issues remaining: 67
python: 2.x only
```

Mix of yellow/orange badges showing active work.

### Example 3: Nearly Complete

**Badges close to finish:**

```
migration: nearly complete
migration progress: 92%
files migrated: 62/67
issues remaining: 8
python: 2.x only
```

Mostly green badges, very motivating!

### Example 4: Complete

**Badges when done:**

```
migration: complete
migration progress: 100%
files migrated: 67/67
issues remaining: none
python: 3.x ready
```

All bright green - time to celebrate! 🎉

## Troubleshooting

### Badges Show 0/0 Files

**Problem:** Badges show "0/0" or "no files"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you're in the project root directory
2. Run verifier first: `./py2to3 check .`
3. Collect stats first: `./py2to3 stats collect --save`
4. Make sure there are .py files in your project

### Badges Not Showing in GitHub

**Problem:** Badges don't display in GitHub README

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure badges are committed: `git add badges/ && git commit`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push`
3. Check file paths in markdown match actual file locations
4. Use relative paths: `badges/migration-progress.svg`

### Badge Colors Don't Update

**Problem:** Regenerating badges but colors stay the same

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check if badge files were actually updated: `ls -la badges/`
3. Verify stats are current: `./py2to3 stats show`
4. Run verifier to refresh data: `./py2to3 check .`

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Can't write to badges directory

**Solutions:**
1. Check directory permissions: `ls -la badges/`
2. Create directory manually: `mkdir -p badges`
3. Use custom output directory: `./py2to3 badges --output ~/my-badges`
